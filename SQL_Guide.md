**Overview**

1. Introduction & Setup

## 1. Introduction & Setup

Relational databases are collections of inter-related tables able to collect very large amounts of data.
SQL is the interfacing language with which we can interact with those relational databases.
Each table is like a spreadsheet tab (but can contain much more data): columns are fields, rows are entries.
There are many implementations of SQL, being [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) one of them: it is open source, free; PostgreSQL has additional methods, but they are clearly warned here.

Alternatives to PostgreSQL: MySQL, Oracle, etc.

### 1.1 Installation: `PostgreSQL` & `pgAdmin`

We install two things (on a Mac; Windows is equivalent):
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org): SQL engine to interact with our databases
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org): web-based GUI to interact with our databases using PostgreSQL; one of the most popular.

Documenation / Help:
- [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/)
- [pgAdmin Documentation](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/6.5/index.html)

In the following, installation instructions are provided following an indented style I use typically for howtos.
Also, an example database `dvdrentals` from the Udemy course is restored.

```

Install PostgreSQL
    Download PostgreSQL installer from web (V. 14.2): https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/
    Click on intaller
    Select/leave default
    Password
        o-y-a
        do not forget it, otherwise we need to re-install it again!
        PostgreDQL superuser pw
    Port: 5432 (leave suggested one)
        Make sure port is not blocked by any firewall
        PostgreSQL will be listening on that port
    Next, next, next
    Finish

Install pgAdmin
    Download pgAdmin from web: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/
        pgAdmin 4 - v6.5
        Download the DMG file: pgadmin4-6.5.dmg
    Click on DMG installed: drag & drop app to Applications folder

Restart computer
    A new postgres user might appear

Open pgAdmin
    A new pw is required: master pw for pgAdmin
        although it is a different one,
        we can use the same as for PostgreSQL
        o-y-a
    The browser or a web-based GUI is opened
    We can connect to engine servers on the left panel
        introduce postgres pw

Restore Example Database
    Udemy course material: example database file that should not be uncompressed:
    `./data/dvdrental.tar`

    On pgAdmin:
    Select PostgreSQL on left panel > Databases
        Right click: create: dvdrental
            New database appears on left panel
        Right click on dvdrental DB > Restore...
            Path to dvdrental.tar
            Options/data-object
                sections: activate
                    Data, Pre-Data, Post-Data
            Restore
        Right click on dvdrental DB > Refresh
            Changes take place!

Test we can interact with our restored DB using SQL
    On pgAdmin left panel: 
    Right click on dvdrental DB > Query Tool
    Insert
        SELECT * FROM film;
    Run (Play button)
        We get all entries from film table

```

### 1.2 `pgAdmin` Overview

We often interact with a database using SQL in a tool such as `pgAdmin`.
In the following, a schematic overview is given with an indented style.

```
Left panel: Servers: PostgreSQL engine is a server
    Databases hanging from it
    We can have several servers if we have several PostgreSQL versions installed
    Every time we connect to a server, we need to introduce the postgres user pw
Right side: Dashboard
    If selected a database, its activity is shown on dashboard
File > Preferences
    Themes (Dark)
    Query tool: font size, etc.
    Dashboards: choose what to display
We can select an object on the left panel
    and right click for options
    or on menu, then select Object / Tool

DB, right click -> Query Tool (dvdrental)
    Tabs
        Query Editor: we write our SQL queries here
        Query History: list of all SQL queries we have performed, very useful!
            Copy / Copy to Editor
        Output: result after running the query
    To execute a query: Run / Play / F5
```

## 2. SQL Statement Fundamentals

The way we are going to use to interact with the database (DB) `dvdrental` is `pgAdmin`. We select the database > right click > Query Tool. There, we input our queries, capitalizing by convention SQL tokens for readability, although that is not technically necessary.

A database (DB) is composed by tables that contain columns or fields. In `pgAdmin`, those tables and fields can be seen in the `Schemas`:
- select DB, expand its items
- item `Schemas`
- subitems `Tables`, `Columns`

Some general notes:
- Comments are created with `--`; that can be anywhere
- Statements can be in one or multiple lines
- A statement finishes with `;`

###  `SELECT`

 `SELECT` is used to extract the entries of desired columns from desired tables.

```sql
-- Grab two columns from a table
-- Note that query order is irrelevant
-- SQL might also return in another order, actually the most efficient one
SELECT column_1, column_2 FROM table_name;
-- Grab all columns from a table
-- Do it only if necessary, since we might be pulling a lot of data!
-- It is often a quick & dirty way of visualizing all the columns/fields of a table
SELECT * FROM table_name;
-- dvdrental examples
SELECT * FROM actor;
SELECT last_name, first_name FROM actor;
SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customer;
```

###  `SELECT DISTINCT`

`SELECT DISTINCT` selects entries (rows) in a column that are unique.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name
-- We should use parenthesis if several columns are queried
SELECT DISTINCT(column_name) FROM table_name
-- dvdrental examples
SELECT DISTINCT release_year FROM film;
SELECT DISTINCT(rental_rate) FROM film;
SELECT DISTINCT(rating) FROM film;
```

###  `COUNT`

The function `COUNT` returns the number of rows/entries that match a condition.

```sql
-- COUNT() is a function, it needs ()
-- It counts the rows/entries in the passed column/table
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
-- If no condition is passed, it does not matter which column we use, we can pass *
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
-- It makes sense to combine it with conditions or other functions
-- Count number of distinct last names from all customers
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(last_name)) FROM customer;
-- dvdrental examples
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(amount)) FROM payment;
```

###  `SELECT WHERE`

`SELECT WHERE` allows to define conditions to the rows of the selected columns.
Conditions can be defined with:

- comparison operators: `=, >, <, >=, <=, <>, !=`
- logical operators: `AND, OR, NOT`

Note that there is no `==` and that not-equal can be done in two ways: `<>, !=`

```sql
-- General syntax (it can be in one line)
SELECT col_1, col_2
FROM table_a
WHERE condition_alpha;
-- Example: Select entries from fields name & choice, in which name is "David"
SELECT name, choice
FROM table
WHERE name = 'David';
-- Example: multiple conditions
SELECT name, choice
FROM table
WHERE name = 'David' AND choice = 'Red';
-- dvdrental examples
SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name = 'Jared';
```
