**Overview**

1. Introduction & Setup

## 1. Introduction & Setup

Relational databases are collections of inter-related tables able to collect very large amounts of data.
SQL is the interfacing language with which we can interact with those relational databases.
Each table is like a spreadsheet tab (but can contain much more data): columns are fields, rows are entries.
There are many implementations of SQL, being [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) one of them: it is open source, free; PostgreSQL has additional methods, but they are clearly warned here.

### 1.1 Installation: PostgreSQL & pgAdmin

We install two things (on a Mac; Windows is equivalent):
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org): SQL engine to interact with our databases
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org): web-based GUI to interact with our databases using PostgreSQL; one of the most popular.

```

Install PostgreSQL
    Download PostgreSQL installer from web (V. 14.2): https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/
    Click on intaller
    Select/leave default
    Password
        o-y-a
        do not forget it, otherwise we need to re-install it again!
        PostgreDQL superuser pw
    Port: 5432 (leave suggested one)
        Make sure port is not blocked by any firewall
        PostgreSQL will be listening on that port
    Next, next, next
    Finish

Install pgAdmin
    Download pgAdmin from web: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/
        pgAdmin 4 - v6.5
        Download the DMG file: pgadmin4-6.5.dmg
    Click on DMG installed: drag & drop app to Applications folder

Restart computer
    A new postgres user might appear

Open pgAdmin
    A new pw is required: master pw for pgAdmin
        although it is a different one,
        we can use the same as for PostgreSQL
        o-y-a
    The browser or a web-based GUI is opened
    We can connect to engine servers on the left panel
        introduce postgres pw

Restore Example Database
    Udemy course material: example database file that should not be uncompressed:
    `./data/dvdrental.tar`

    On pgAdmin:
    Select PostgreSQL on left panel > Databases
        Right click: create: dvdrental
            New database appears on left panel
        Right click on dvdrental DB > Restore...
            Path to dvdrental.tar
            Options/data-object
                sections: activate
                    Data, Pre-Data, Post-Data
            Restore
        Right click on dvdrental DB > Refresh
            Changes take place!

Test we can interact with our restored DB using SQL
    On pgAdmin left panel: 
    Right click on dvdrental DB > Query Tool
    Insert
        SELECT * FROM film;
    Run (Play button)
        We get all entries from film table

```
