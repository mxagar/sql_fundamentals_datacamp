# SQL Guide

This repository contains my personal guide on SQL. **The actual guide is contained in the file [`SQL_Guide.md`](SQL_Guide.md).** All levels are covered progressively, so just open the file and follow it :wink:. Additionally, I plan to create a summary/cheat sheet: [`sql_catalogue.txt`](sql_catalogue.txt).

I composed this document after refreshing my SQL knowledge by following several courses/tutorials:

- [The Complete SQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/), created by Jos√© Marcial Portilla (Udemy)
- [SQL for Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198) by Udacity.
- [Python MySQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_mysql_getstarted.asp) from W3schools.
