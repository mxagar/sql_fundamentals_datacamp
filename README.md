# SQL Guide

This repository contains my notes after refreshing my SQL knowledge by following [The Complete SQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/) by Jos√© Marcial Portilla from Udemy.

The [The Complete SQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/) is composed by the following sections:

1. Introduction & Setup
2. SQL Statement Fundamentals
3. GROUP BY Statements
4. JOINS
5. Advanced SQL Commands
6. Creating Databases and Tables
7. Conditional Expressions and Procedures
8. PostGreSQL with Python

The file `./SQL_Guide.md` is a **summary/guide of my notes and SQL in general**.

There is another series of courses I considered at Datacamp: The [SQL Fundamentals skill track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/sql-fundamentals), which is composed by the following courses:

1. [Introduction to SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql)
2. [Joining Data in SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/joining-data-in-sql)
3. [Intermediate SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-sql)
4. [PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/postgresql-summary-stats-and-window-functions)
5. [Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/functions-for-manipulating-data-in-postgresql)
