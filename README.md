# SQL Guide

This repository contains my personal guide on SQL. **All the notes are contained in the file [`SQL_Guide.md`](SQL_Guide.md).** All levels are covered progressively, so just open the file and follow it :wink:. Additionally, I made a summary/cheat sheet: [`sql_catalogue.txt`](sql_catalogue.txt).

I composed this document after refreshing my SQL knowledge by following [The Complete SQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/), created by Jos√© Marcial Portilla (Udemy). Another interesting course I checked and used is the [SQL for Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198) by Udacity.
